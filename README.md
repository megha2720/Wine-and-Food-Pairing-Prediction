# Wine-and-Food-Pairing-Prediction
📘Project Overview

This project explores the fascinating relationship between wine types and food pairings.
The goal is to build a predictive model that classifies the pairing quality score between wine and food, rated on a scale from 1 (Terrible) to 5 (Excellent).

The dataset provides information on wine style, food flavor profile, cuisine, and regional characteristics — enabling us to uncover how these factors influence pairing success and customer preference.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze how different wine and food attributes impact pairing quality.

Build a classification model to predict pairing scores (1–5).

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.

Interpret model insights to understand which wine styles best complement specific cuisines or dishes.

🤖 Modeling Approach

The problem is a multi-class classification task (scores 1–5).
Several models were tested:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

LightGBM Classifier

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score
